MAPD A Exam project files                

**How to use this repository:**

- The report in pdf format (source [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfjrkymfczcf)) and the "mapd" jupyter notebook contain the main results of this project;                        
- the `src` folder contains the vhdl code which was used to program the FPGA;                                      
- the `data` folder contains a MATLAB script which was used to extract the data from the song, plus the resulting data (which we fed to the FPGA) and the output it returned to us;                        
- the `files_on_remote_machine` is a backup of what we uploaded to the remote machine throughout the course of this project (e.g. the python scripts needed to communicate with the FPGA through the serial port);
- and finally the `test` folder contains intermediate files, used between us to cooperate on the analysis and exchange non-final results.

TL;DR: read the pdf and maybe check the jupyter notebook, poke around the rest if you're curious.
